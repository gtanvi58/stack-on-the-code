# stack-on-the-code
### Introduction
StackOnTheCode is a VS Code extension to generate code/error summaries using data from StackOverflow and LLMs. This extension was inspired by our own experiences working on VSCode and finding it tedious to constantly flip back between VSCode and the browser for debugging and StackOverflow searching. StackOnTheCode eliminates the need for web browser searching by allowing you to get StackOverflow answers right in VSCode's webview. Additionally, we use an LLM to summarize the StackOverflow responses and a ranking of the best 3 responses to return more concise and useful answers to the user. We are also using a ranking algorithm in our summary based on the score of the StackOverflow answer and the reputation of the author.
